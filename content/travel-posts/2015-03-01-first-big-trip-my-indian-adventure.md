Since this was a really long trip I am going to divide up into **four** blog posts. This is post one.


## How it all started?

I was in my 2nd year of University studying a BE(Hons)/BSc conjoint. I really should've been looking for a summer internship, but two of my close-family members were getting hitched! There was no way I could've missed either of their weddings and it was the perfect excuse for me to go travel. 

It was my first experience travelling overseas alone, I was 20 years old, had zero responsibilities, a small bunch of savings from tutoring for a couple of years and an eagerness to see the world. Once I had my heart set on travelling I made up a loose itinerary, booked a bunch of flights for the day after exams and flew off on an adventure which would make me fall in love with travel and also fall into a love-hate relationship with my home country, India.

## My Itinerary

Mark Twain had described india as: *"This is India! the land of dreams and romance, of fabulous wealth and fabulous poverty, of splendor and rags, of palaces and hovels, of famine and pestilence, of genii and giants and Aladdin lamps, of tigers and elephants, the cobra and the jungle.* Based on my experience, I don't think I could describe it any better.

Here is the loose itinerary I followed:

- 5 days Singapore
- 5 days New Delhi (Wedding 1 - Nipun)
- 8 days Leh, Kashmir
- 7 days New Delhi (Wedding 2 - Ankit)
- 9 days Mumbai
- 6 days Goa
- 4 days Hampi
- 5 days Bangalore
- 12 days Kerala
- 2 days Mumbai
- 3 days Jaipur
- 5 days Pushkar
- 3 days Jaisalmer
- 7 days New Delhi (Wedding 3 - uncles friend)
- 3 days Adelaide
- 5 days Gold Coast
- 3 days Melbourne

**In total 94 days away.**

## First Stop: Singapore

Singapore is a fantastic, tiny and **humid** country. Most often it seen as just a place to stop on the way to somewhere else however, in this trip I sent 5 days exploring the little city-country. Despite being in Asia, Singapore is still quite expensive, infact the most expensive place in Asia I have been other than Tokyo.

I was lucky enough to have family living in Singapore and as such had free accomodation (one of the cousins getting married in India in the same trip).

Singapore has an awesome public transport system, making navigating and travelling around extremely easy and efficient. You can use the buses (which are *ALWAYS* on time - seriously Auckland Transport could learn a thing or two) or the great Singapore MRT (Mass Rapid Transit).  Both bus and MRT use a single, contactless payment system: the EZ-Link card.

### Where I went?
- Sentosa Island:
    - Universal Studios and Hard-Rock Cafe
- Marina Bay Sands
- China Town
- Orchard
- Gardens by the Bay
- **lots and lots of food - Make sure you checkout Din Tai Fung in Marina Bay for some epic dumplings**

## Second Stop: New Delhi and Wedding 1

I land in India and the first thing I notice is a thick layer of pollution cloud resting over Delhi. I make my way through the chaotic airport, pick up a few bottles of Glenlivet and head out of the airport to get picked up by my cousin Nipun and his fiance, Chinky.

The next few days go into helping out with the wedding, picking up guests and doing lots of shopping. An Indian wedding is an extraorbitant affair, spreading over 5 days. Each day is a different function, and as such require a different set of clothes and consist of different activities. However, one thing remains consistent: The mornings are meant for recovery from the previous nights escapades, the afternoons are filled with ancient hindu rituals coupled with endless laughter and banter within the family and finally the evenings with dancing, eating and a whole lot of drinking (especially at Punjabi weddings).

Nipuns wedding was an incredibly fun experience and it was great catching up with the entire family who flew in from all over the world to celebrate in India. 

In my next post I will talk about heading to the northern-most part of India, *Leh*. I will also talk about my travels down to Mumbai, Goa, and Hampi.
