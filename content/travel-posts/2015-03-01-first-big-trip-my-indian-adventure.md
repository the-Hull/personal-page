## How it all started?

I was in my 2nd year of University studying a BE(Hons)/BSc conjoint. I really should've been looking for a summer internship, but two of my close-family members were getting hitched! There was no way I could've missed either of their weddings and it was the perfect excuse for me to go travel. 

It was my first experience travelling alone overseas, I was 20 years old, had zero responsibilities, a small bunch of savings from tutoring for a couple of years and an eagerness to see the world. Once I had my heart set on travelling I made up a loose itenirary, booked a bunch of flights for the day after exams and flew off on an adventure which would make fall in love with travel and fall into a love-hate relationship with my home country.

## What happened?

Mark Twain had described india as: *"This is India! the land of dreams and romance, of fabulous wealth and fabulous poverty, of splendor and rags, of palaces and hovels, of famine and pestilence, of genii and giants and Aladdin lamps, of tigers and elephants, the cobra and the jungle.* Based on my experience, I don't think I could describe it any better.

Here is the loose itenirary I followed:

- 5 days Singapore
- 5 days New Delhi (Wedding 1 - Nipun)
- 8 days Leh, Kashmir
- 7 days New Delhi (Wedding 2 - Ankit)
- 9 days Mumbai
- 6 days Goa
- 4 days Hampi
- 5 days Bangalore
- 12 days Kerala
- 2 days Mumbai
- 3 days Jaipur
- 5 days Pushkar
- 3 days Jaisalmer
- 7 days New Delhi (Wedding 3 - uncles friend)
- 3 days Adelaide
- 5 days Gold Coast
- 3 days Melbourne

**In total 94 days away.**
