Jullay! Welcome to part 2 of my India series. This is post two, where I'll talk about my journey around Ladakh with my dear friend Vivan, Ankits wedding, Mumbai, my craziest new years experience ever in Goa and then chilling out in Hampi.

## Leh/Ladakh

### The Journey

I had just come out of an incredible 5 days at Nipuns wedding and my body was shattered, I was hungover, full of food and was lying in my bed with my head still pounding. My phone vibrates, I look over and its a message from Vivan, "landed". Vivan and I had planned this trip a few months prior. We were planning on embarking into the Himalayas in the middle of winter. Some folk had told us we were crazy, but we were convinced that this was going to be the journey of a life time. The next day, I went over to Vivan's cousins place and the following morning we headed to Indira-Gandhi Airport.

We got onto our flight and there was literally 4 (excluding the hosting staff and pilots) people in the aircraft: Vivan, a buddhist monk, another Indian tourist and myself. The aircraft climbed through the pollution cloud of New Delhi and we caught a glimpse of snow-capped mountains from afar. As we got closer and closer the plane didn't decrease in altitude, but ground got higher.

Once we landed and got out of the flight we were welcomed by a freezing breeze of about -10 degrees. Having just witnessed the most beautiful views we had ever seen in our life, Vivan and I were not phased by the temperature but energised to explore this barren and daunting landscape. The whole town of Ladakh was empty, not a single taxi tout harassing us, we needed to find a way to Sia-La Guest House. After wandering around the car park we somehow found ourselves engaged in a conversation with the Buddhist monk from our flight, who ended up offering us a trip to our accommodation. It was our first experience with people in Ladakh and needless to say, everyone else we interacted with was just as friendly!

### Lamayuru

Our first day was our expedition to Lamayuru. A beautiful monastery located south of Ladakh. We instructed our very friendly guest-house host, Sonia, to arrange a driver for us. Our driver was Saleem, a friendly middle-aged man who had spent the majority of his life in the Leh-Ladakh region of Kashmir. Saleem would go onto be our driver for the remainder of the trip, entertaining and educating us with the stories of how the conflicted past of the Kashmir region had impacted his life.

Upon arriving to Lamayuru, we found ourselves in a barren-budhist monastery surrounded by ragged dusty mountains, we walked around, taking photos, exploring. You see, Vivan and I had spent our evenings in Leh watching Avatar, the last Airbender. We somehow found ourselves re-enacting scenes from ATLA and re-living the life of the Air Nomads.

On the drive back to Leh, we stopped off at a frozen waterfall, the meeting-point of two rivers, and a few smaller budhist temples.

### Lake Pangong

Lake Pangong is a go-to on any Indian's bucket-list. After recieving alot of attention from Aamir Khan's 3 Idiots, the lake has become a travel stop for many around the world. The evening prior to our expedition to Pangong, we had met a fascinating individual from Hyderbad, Vikas, who came to Leh to "discover himself". Vikas was a self-proclaimed spirtualist, who came searching for the true meaning of life, detaching himself from his day job as Reuters Journalist.

Given we were students at the time and Saleem was charging a steep fee, we offered Vikas to join us on our journey. Unfortunately for Vikas, during the drive he was unable to handle the constant head clunking and bouncing dictated upon us by the rough terrain and the poorly maintained roads. Sadly Vikas spent the majority of the drive recovering from chugging his guts out 3-4 times on the drive there and back. 

Arriving at Pangong, we found ourselves to be the only people there. Vivan, Vivek, Vikas in the middle of the Himalayas, 3.5 Km above sea-level at one of the world's most pristine lakes. It was a sobering moment and we enjoyed the short time we spent there before heading back.

The remainder of our time in Leh was spent exploring the palace, checking out Shanti Stuppa and the Leh Ladakh markets.
