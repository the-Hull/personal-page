Jullay! Welcome to part 2 of my India series. This is post two, where I'll talk about my journey around Ladakh with my dear friend Vivan, Ankits wedding, Mumbai, my craziest new years experience ever in Goa and then chilling out in Hampi.

## Leh/Ladakh

I had just come out of an incredible 5 days at Nipuns wedding and my body was shattered, I was hungover, full of food and was lying in my bed with my head still pounding. My phone vibrates, I look over and its a message from Vivan, "landed". Vivan and I had planned this trip a few months prior. We were planning on embarking into the Himalayas in the middle of winter. Some folk had told us we were crazy, but we were convinced that this was going to be the journey of a life time. The next day, I went over to Vivan's cousins place and the following morning we headed to Indira-Gandhi Airport.

We got onto our flight and there was literally 4 (excluding the hosting staff and pilots) people in the aircraft: Vivan, a buddhist monk, another Indian tourist and myself. The aircraft climbed through the pollution cloud of New Delhi and we caught a glimpse of snow-capped mountains from afar. As we got closer and closer the plane didn't decrease in Altitude, but the mountains got closer. I have been on over a 100 flights in my life so far and nothing has ever compared to this one.

Once we landed and got out of the flight we were welcomed by a freezing breeze of about -10 degrees.
