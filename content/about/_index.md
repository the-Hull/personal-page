This isn't really maintained too much, but I will try and do a better job. My day-to-day is occupied by my PhD where I am investigating different instance characteristics of combinatorial optimisation problems on Quantum Computers.

On top of this I also do a bunch of other work; I am currently consulting as a Data Scientist with Multitudes, working as a fellow of the Good Data Institute, and also a teaching assistant for the Supply Chain Analytics course in the Masters of Business Analytics Course at Melbourne Business School.

I am a super nerd who loves math, coding and travel. I enjoy getting my hands  dirty in data and am always looking for opportunities where data can be used to make the world a better place to live. If you're interested in being a thought-partner feel free to connect!"
