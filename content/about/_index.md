{{< figure src="/images/florence.jpg" title="Here is a picture of me at the Piazzale Michelangelo in Florence." >}}


**Fun fact:** Piazzale Michelangelo was not designed/architected by Michelangelo Buonarroti but it was designed in 1869, a year in which Florence temporarily became the capital of Italy. The architect *Giuseppe Poggi* created the project with the idea of giving tribute to the great works of Michelangelo Buonarroti.
