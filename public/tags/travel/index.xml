      <description>Jullay! Welcome to part 2 of my India series. This is post two, where I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about my journey around Ladakh with my dear friend Vivan, Ankits wedding, Mumbai, my craziest new years experience ever in Goa and then chilling out in Hampi.

      <description>Since this was a really long trip I am going to divide up into four blog posts. This is post one.
How it all started? I was in my 2nd year of University studying a BE(Hons)/BSc conjoint. I really should&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a summer internship, but two of my close-family members were getting hitched! There was no way I could&amp;rsquo;ve missed either of their weddings and it was the perfect excuse for me to go travel.</description>
