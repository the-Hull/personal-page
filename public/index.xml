      <description>How it all started? I was in my 2nd year of University studying a BE(Hons)/BSc conjoint. I really should&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a summer internship, but two of my close-family members were getting hitched! There was no way I could&amp;rsquo;ve missed either of their weddings and it was the perfect excuse for me to go travel.
It was my first experience travelling alone overseas, I was 20 years old, had zero responsibilities, a small bunch of savings from tutoring for a couple of years and an eagerness to see the world.</description>
